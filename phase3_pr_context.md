# Phase 3 PR Review Context for Zen

## Background
This is the final phase of implementing automated queue processing for code-query MCP. Phase 1 established core queue processing, Phase 2 added platform-native service management, and Phase 3 focuses on polish, documentation, and production readiness.

## Phase 3 Goals
- Provide comprehensive documentation for all user types
- Add robust error handling with clear recovery paths
- Create diagnostic and troubleshooting tools
- Implement performance monitoring and metrics
- Polish the user experience with interactive setup

## Key Components
1. **Interactive Setup Wizard** - Guide users through configuration
2. **Diagnostic Tool** - Comprehensive system health checks
3. **Error Handling Framework** - Centralized, user-friendly errors
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Track and optimize processing
5. **Migration Tools** - Help users upgrade from manual mode
6. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Cover all use cases

## Specific Areas for Review
1. **User Experience**: Is the setup wizard intuitive enough?
2. **Error Messages**: Are they helpful and actionable?
3. **Diagnostics**: Any missing checks or edge cases?
4. **Documentation**: Clear enough for non-technical users?
5. **Testing Strategy**: Sufficient coverage?

## Design Decisions
- Opt-in metrics collection for privacy
- Interactive setup vs configuration files
- Diagnostic tool as first-line support
- Migration tool for existing users
- Comprehensive error context

## Questions
- Should we add telemetry/analytics (opt-in)?
- How detailed should performance metrics be?
- Should diagnostics auto-fix simple issues?
- What's the right balance of documentation?
- Should we add a web UI in this phase?

Please review for:
- Completeness of the user journey
- Missing error scenarios
- Documentation clarity
- Testing adequacy
- Overall production readiness
