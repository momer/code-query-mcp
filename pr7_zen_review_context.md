# PR 7 Implementation Plan - Review Context

## Project Context
The Code Query MCP Server now has:
1. Fixed FTS5 tokenizer (PR 1 - complete)
2. Storage backend interface with DTOs (PR 2 - complete)
3. Query builder with fallback support (PR 3 - complete)
4. Search service with dependency injection (PR 4 - complete)
5. Dataset service with lifecycle management (PR 5 - complete)
6. Application layer for documentation workflows (PR 6 - complete)

PR 7 adds analytics and monitoring capabilities to track search performance, identify slow queries, understand usage patterns, and enable data-driven improvements.

## Problem Being Solved
- No visibility into search performance or usage patterns
- Can't identify slow or failing queries
- No data to guide search improvements
- Missing insights into what users search for
- No way to measure search quality over time

## PR 7 Objectives
1. Track all search queries with performance metrics
2. Identify slow queries for optimization
3. Track failed queries to improve search quality
4. Understand popular search terms
5. Provide analytics API for reporting
6. Enable data-driven search improvements

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Asynchronous Collection**: Metrics collected in background thread to avoid blocking searches
2. **Batch Processing**: Queue-based collection with batch writes for efficiency
3. **Separate Storage**: Analytics tables separate from main data
4. **Time-Based Partitioning**: Query logs partitioned by date for efficient cleanup
5. **Automatic Aggregation**: Hourly metrics pre-calculated for fast reporting
6. **Non-Blocking Queue**: Bounded queue that drops metrics rather than blocking

## Technical Context
From previous PRs:
- SearchService (PR 4) is where we'll integrate analytics hooks
- StorageBackend (PR 2) provides the database connection info
- All services use dependency injection
- System designed for minimal performance impact

From the milestone document:
- PR 7 is small size, low risk, medium value
- Should track search performance and usage
- Focus on actionable insights
- Must not impact search performance

## Review Focus Areas
Please review the PR 7 implementation plan focusing on:
1. **Performance Impact**: Will async collection truly avoid impacting search latency?
2. **Data Schema**: Are the analytics tables well-designed for efficient queries?
3. **Metrics Quality**: Are we tracking the right metrics for actionable insights?
4. **Scalability**: Will this handle high query volumes (1000+ QPS)?
5. **Memory Usage**: Could the metrics queue cause memory issues?
6. **Thread Safety**: Any concurrency issues with the collector?
7. **Data Retention**: Is the cleanup strategy appropriate?
8. **Integration Points**: Is the SearchService integration clean?

## Critical Considerations
1. **Queue Overflow**: What happens at very high query rates?
2. **Batch Size Tuning**: How to determine optimal batch size?
3. **Clock Skew**: Time-based partitioning with distributed systems
4. **Privacy**: Ensuring no PII is logged
5. **Debugging**: How to debug when metrics are dropped?
6. **Monitoring**: How to monitor the monitoring system?

## Architecture Implications
1. **Observability Foundation**: This establishes monitoring patterns for other services
2. **Performance Baseline**: Provides data for future optimization
3. **User Behavior**: Insights will drive product decisions
4. **Technical Debt**: Need to maintain analytics alongside features

## Performance Considerations
- Async collection with bounded queue (no blocking)
- Batch writes every 5 seconds or 100 entries
- Separate thread for processing
- Indexed queries for all analytics reads
- Automatic data cleanup after retention period
