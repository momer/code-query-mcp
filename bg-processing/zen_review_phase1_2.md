# Background Processing Implementation Review - Phases 1 & 2

## Project Context
We're implementing background processing for the Code Query MCP Server to handle documentation updates asynchronously. This allows git hooks to queue files for processing without blocking the git workflow.

## Overall Goals
- Implement Huey-based task queue for asynchronous documentation processing
- Create worker management system for starting/stopping background processors
- Enable git hooks to queue files instead of processing them synchronously
- Support both manual and automatic processing modes

## Phase 1: Huey Task Definitions (Completed)

### What We Built
Created `tasks.py` with:
1. Huey initialization using SqliteHuey backend
2. `process_file_documentation` task - processes single files with retry logic
3. `process_documentation_batch` task - processes multiple files in batch
4. Logging configuration for worker processes
5. Placeholder for Claude response parsing (to be implemented later)

### Key Design Decisions
- Used SqliteHuey for zero-dependency queue storage
- Set retries=2 with 60s delay for resilience
- Single worker configuration for simplicity
- Logs stored in `.code-query/worker.log`

## Phase 2: Worker Initialization & Configuration (Completed)

### What We Built
Created `cli/worker_manager.py` with WorkerManager class providing:
1. `start_worker()` - Launches Huey consumer as daemon process
2. `stop_worker()` - Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, force kill with SIGKILL
3. `restart_worker()` - Stop and start sequence
4. `display_worker_status()` - Shows PID, CPU, memory, recent logs
5. PID file management with atomic writes to prevent corruption
6. Process verification using psutil to detect stale PIDs

### Key Design Decisions
- Used `huey_consumer.py` command directly (not Python module)
- Single worker thread for predictable behavior
- Atomic PID file writes using temp file + rename
- 10-second grace period for SIGTERM before SIGKILL
- Comprehensive status display including process metrics

## Code Quality Considerations

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing PID files
- Process existence verification before operations
- Fallback from SIGTERM to SIGKILL
- Proper cleanup of stale PID files

### Platform Compatibility
- Uses `os.setsid()` for Unix daemonization (with hasattr check)
- Cross-platform process management via psutil
- Future consideration for Windows Service wrapper

### Security
- No command injection risks (using list-based subprocess calls)
- PID file in project-specific directory
- No elevated privileges required

## Testing Results
- Worker starts successfully and registers both tasks
- PID tracking works correctly
- Status display shows accurate process information
- Graceful shutdown via SIGTERM confirmed
- Log redirection functioning properly

## Files to Review
1. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/tasks.py`
2. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/cli/worker_manager.py`
3. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/requirements.txt` (updated with huey and psutil)

## Questions for Review
1. Is the error handling in WorkerManager comprehensive enough?
2. Should we add more robust Claude response parsing in tasks.py?
3. Is the single worker configuration appropriate, or should we make it configurable?
4. Any security concerns with the subprocess execution approach?
5. Should we add health check endpoints for monitoring?

## Next Phases
- Phase 3: Git hook logic updates
- Phase 4: Worker detection
- Phase 5: Queue management
- Phase 6: Configuration schema

- Security vulnerabilities
- Error handling completeness
- Performance considerations
- Code style and best practices
- Potential edge cases we missed
