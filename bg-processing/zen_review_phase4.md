# Background Processing Implementation Review - Phase 4

## Project Context
We're implementing background processing for the Code Query MCP Server. We've completed:
- Phase 1: Huey task definitions (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 2: Worker management (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 3: Git hook logic (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 4: Worker detection improvements (NEW - needs review)

## Phase 4: Enhanced Worker Detection

### What We Built
1. **Lightweight Worker Detector** (`helpers/worker_detector.py`):
   - Dependency-free detection for use in git hooks
   - PID validation and process verification
   - Enhanced validation via /proc filesystem on Linux
   - Stale PID file cleanup functionality
   - Worker info retrieval (PID, uptime, status)

2. **Worker CLI Commands** (`cli/worker_commands.py`):
   - Complete worker management CLI
   - Commands: start, stop, restart, status, logs, cleanup
   - Detailed and quick status options
   - Real-time log tailing

3. **Updated Git Hook Handler**:
   - Now uses the enhanced worker detector
   - Imports moved to top of file (Python best practice)
   - More reliable worker detection

### Key Design Decisions
- **Dual Detection Strategy**: Full WorkerManager uses psutil, git hooks use lightweight detection
- **Process Validation**: Checks /proc/PID/cmdline for 'huey' and 'tasks'
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back safely on non-Linux systems
- **No External Dependencies**: Git hooks remain fast and dependency-free

### Security Considerations
- PID file validation prevents injection
- No shell commands used
- Safe file operations with proper error handling
- Process validation prevents PID reuse attacks

### Architecture Notes
- Worker detector is standalone module
- CLI commands use Click framework
- Detection methods are cross-platform compatible
- Stale PID cleanup is automatic

## Files to Review
1. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/helpers/worker_detector.py` (NEW)
2. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/cli/worker_commands.py` (NEW)
3. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/helpers/git_hook_handler.py` (modified - uses new detector)
4. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/bg-processing/phase4_implementation_summary.md`

## Critical Questions
1. Is the PID validation sufficient to prevent attacks?
2. Any race conditions in worker detection?
3. Is /proc parsing safe from injection?
4. Should we add rate limiting to status checks?
5. Are the CLI commands properly isolated?

## Testing Performed
- Module imports successfully
- Basic function calls work
- PID validation logic tested
- CLI command structure validated

Please review for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Race conditions
- Input validation completeness
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance concerns
