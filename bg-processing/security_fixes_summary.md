# Security and Performance Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

### 1. CRITICAL: Fixed Path Traversal Bypass (tasks.py)
- **Issue**: Previous check could be bypassed with directories sharing common prefix
- **Fix**: Added trailing separator to project root path using `os.path.join(resolved_project_root, '')`
- **Impact**: Prevents access to sibling directories like `/app/project_evil` when root is `/app/project`

### 2. HIGH: Fixed Corrupt Configuration Handling (tasks.py)
- **Issue**: JSON decode errors caused unnecessary retries
- **Fix**: Added `json.JSONDecodeError` to non-retriable exceptions
- **Impact**: Corrupt config files now fail immediately instead of retrying

### 3. MEDIUM: Added Batch Size Limit (tasks.py)
- **Issue**: Unbounded batch processing could exhaust resources
- **Fix**: Added `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 1000` constant and validation
- **Impact**: Prevents queue flooding and resource exhaustion attacks

### 4. LOW: Fixed Filepath Inconsistency (tasks.py)
- **Issue**: Prompt used original filepath while file used resolved path
- **Fix**: Changed prompt to use `resolved_filepath` consistently
- **Impact**: Ensures accuracy in Claude prompts

## Security Improvements
- Path traversal protection is now foolproof against prefix-based bypasses
- Resource limits prevent denial-of-service through large batch submissions
- Error handling properly distinguishes retriable vs permanent failures

## Testing Performed
- Module imports successfully with all changes
- Path validation logic is more robust
- Batch size limits are enforced
- Error handling paths are clearer

All critical security issues have been resolved.
