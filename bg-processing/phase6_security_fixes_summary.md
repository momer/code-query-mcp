# Phase 6 Security Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL: Command Injection Risk via Unvalidated Model Name
- **Issue**: Environment variable could inject arbitrary model names without validation
- **Risk**: If model name used in shell commands, could lead to command injection
- **Fix**: 
  - Added model name sanitization with regex validation
  - Only allow alphanumeric characters, dots, dashes, and underscores
  - Limit model name length to 100 characters
  - Validate configuration after environment overrides applied
- **Implementation**:
  - Model names validated with `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$` regex
  - `load_config_with_env_override` now validates final config
  - Custom models allowed but sanitized

### 2. HIGH: Race Condition in update_processing_mode
- **Issue**: Non-atomic read-modify-write could lose concurrent updates
- **Fix**: Added file locking with FileLock for atomic operations
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `filelock` dependency
  - All config updates now wrapped in `FileLock` context
  - Lock file created at `config.json.lock`

### 3. HIGH: Race Condition in Cache Invalidation (TOCTOU)
- **Issue**: File could be modified between mtime check and read
- **Fix**: Cache checks now happen inside file lock
- **Implementation**:
  - `load_config` wraps entire operation in FileLock
  - Cache validity checked within lock context
  - Prevents stale cache reads

### 4. HIGH: Silent Failure on Invalid Environment Variable
- **Issue**: Invalid CODEQUERY_BATCH_SIZE silently ignored
- **Fix**: Raise explicit errors for invalid environment values
- **Implementation**:
  - Invalid batch size now raises ValueError with details
  - All environment overrides validated before use
  - Clear error messages for debugging

### 5. MEDIUM: Incomplete Validation of Processing Config
- **Issue**: Several processing fields not validated
- **Fix**: Added validation for all processing fields
- **Implementation**:
  - `max_retries`: Must be non-negative integer
  - `worker_check_interval`: Must be positive number
  - `queue_timeout`: Must be non-negative number
  - `fallback_to_sync`: Must be boolean

### 6. MEDIUM: exclude_patterns Not Validated
- **Issue**: Could accept non-list or non-string values
- **Fix**: Added type validation for exclude_patterns
- **Implementation**:
  - Must be a list
  - All items must be strings
  - Prevents crashes in downstream pattern matching

## Additional Improvements

### Separated Loading and Validation
- Added `load_raw_config()` method for loading without validation
- Added `validate_config()` method for explicit validation
- Enables proper validation after environment overrides

### Better Error Messages
- All validation errors now include specific details
- Environment variable errors show the invalid value
- Model validation explains allowed characters
