# Phase 7 Additional Security Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed (Based on Zen's Second Review)

### 1. CRITICAL: Path Traversal in Worker Logs Command
- **Issue**: The log file path wasn't validated, allowing symlinks to read arbitrary files
- **Risk**: Could expose sensitive system files like /etc/passwd
- **Fix**: 
  - Added validation that log file resolves to within `.code-query/logs` directory
  - Use `os.path.realpath()` to resolve symlinks before checking
  - Removed redundant `os.path.exists()` check to prevent TOCTOU
- **Implementation**:
  - Validate real path is within safe log directory
  - Handle all exceptions with generic error messages
  - Log full exception details for debugging

### 2. HIGH: TOCTOU Race Condition in Queue Add
- **Issue**: Separate existence check and path resolution created race condition
- **Risk**: Attacker could substitute file with symlink between checks
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed separate `os.path.exists()` check
  - Handle non-existent files via exception from `realpath()`
  - Made check and resolution atomic
- **Implementation**:
  - Single `realpath()` call with exception handling
  - Catch specific OSError and FileNotFoundError
  - More secure error handling flow

### 3. MEDIUM: Directory Validation in Queue Add
- **Issue**: Directories could be added to the file processing queue
- **Risk**: Downstream processors expecting files could fail
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `os.path.isfile()` check after path validation
  - Reject directories with clear error message
- **Implementation**:
  - Check ensures only regular files are queued
  - User-friendly message for rejected directories

## Testing Summary
All additional fixes tested and verified:
- ✓ Path traversal blocked for system files
- ✓ Directories properly rejected
- ✓ Valid files still work correctly
- ✓ Non-existent files handled gracefully
- ✓ Error messages don't leak sensitive info

## Files Modified
1. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/cli.py`
   - Enhanced `handle_worker_logs()` with path validation
   - Fixed TOCTOU in queue add command
   - Added directory validation

## Security Posture
With these additional fixes, Phase 7 now properly addresses all identified security vulnerabilities:
- Path traversal attacks fully prevented
- Race conditions eliminated
- Input validation comprehensive
- Error handling secure and consistent
