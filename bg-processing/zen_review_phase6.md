# Background Processing Implementation Review - Phase 6

## Project Context
We're implementing background processing for the Code Query MCP Server. We've completed:
- Phase 1: Huey task definitions (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 2: Worker management (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 3: Git hook logic (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 4: Worker detection improvements (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 5: Queue management CLI (reviewed and secured)
- Phase 6: Configuration schema extensions (NEW - needs review)

## Phase 6: Configuration Schema Extensions

### What We Built
1. **ConfigManager** (`storage/config_manager.py`):
   - Comprehensive configuration management with validation
   - Deep merging of user config with defaults
   - Atomic file operations
   - Configuration caching with mtime-based invalidation
   - Type validation for all fields

2. **ConfigMigrator**:
   - Schema version auto-detection
   - Sequential migration support (v0→v1→v2)
   - Backward compatibility for old configs

3. **Environment Variable Support**:
   - Override configuration via environment variables
   - Supports model, processing mode, and batch size overrides

### Key Design Decisions
- **JSON format**: Human-readable, easy to edit
- **Deep merging**: Users only need to specify overrides
- **Validation-first**: All configs validated before saving
- **Atomic operations**: Prevent corruption from concurrent access
- **Schema versioning**: Smooth migration path for future changes

### Security Considerations
- No code execution (pure JSON)
- Type validation prevents injection
- Atomic writes prevent corruption
- Path validation (no automatic path discovery)

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "dataset_name": "required",
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
  "processing": {
    "mode": "manual|auto",
    "fallback_to_sync": true,
    "batch_size": 5,
    "delay_seconds": 300,
    "max_retries": 2,
    "worker_check_interval": 5,
    "queue_timeout": 30
  },
  "exclude_patterns": ["patterns..."]
}
```

## Files to Review
1. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/storage/config_manager.py` (NEW)
2. `/home/momer/projects/dcek/code-query-mcp/bg-processing/phase6_implementation_summary.md`

## Critical Questions
1. Is the validation comprehensive enough?
2. Any security issues with the migration logic?
3. Should we validate exclude_patterns more strictly?
4. Are the default values reasonable?
5. Any race conditions in the caching logic?

## Testing Performed
- Default config creation
- Validation of invalid configs
- Deep merge functionality
- Schema migration (v0→v1→v2)
- Environment variable overrides
- Cache invalidation
- Atomic write operations
- Validation reporting

Please review for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Validation completeness
- Default value appropriateness
- Migration logic correctness
- Race conditions in caching
