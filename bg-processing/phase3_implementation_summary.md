# Phase 3 Implementation Summary - Git Hook Logic

## What We Built

### 1. Git Hook Handler (`helpers/git_hook_handler.py`)
Created a comprehensive GitHookHandler class that:
- Loads configuration and queue files safely
- Determines sync vs async processing based on mode
- Checks worker status without requiring psutil
- Processes files synchronously when needed
- Enqueues to Huey for background processing
- Handles all errors gracefully (never blocks commits)
- Updates queue atomically to prevent race conditions

### 2. Hook Installation Function (`helpers/git_helper.py`)
Added `install_git_hooks()` function that:
- Properly handles git worktrees by finding actual git directory
- Creates hooks directory if needed
- Writes Python-based post-commit hook
- Makes hook executable
- Works with both regular repos and worktrees

### 3. Key Design Decisions
- **Never block commits**: All errors return 0 to avoid disrupting workflow
- **Atomic queue operations**: Using temp files + rename for safety
- **Cross-platform process check**: Using os.kill(pid, 0) instead of psutil
- **Clear user feedback**: Informative messages for all scenarios
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when worker unavailable

## Testing Results
- Hook handler imports successfully
- Hook installation works correctly
- Post-commit hook created with proper permissions
- All error paths handled gracefully

## Security Considerations
- No command injection risks (using lists for subprocess)
- Queue operations are atomic to prevent corruption
- Configuration errors don't expose sensitive data
- Process checking doesn't require elevated privileges

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Worker detection improvements
- Phase 5: Queue management CLI
- Phase 6: Configuration schema updates
