# Phase 4: Worker Detection Implementation Summary

## What We Built

### 1. Enhanced Worker Detection (`helpers/worker_detector.py`)
- **Lightweight detection** without psutil dependency
- **PID validation**: Checks format and range
- **Process verification**: Uses os.kill(pid, 0) for existence
- **Enhanced validation**: Reads /proc/PID/cmdline on Linux
- **Stale PID cleanup**: Removes files for dead processes

### 2. Updated Git Hook Handler
- Now uses the enhanced `worker_detector` module
- More reliable detection without external dependencies
- Same behavior but better validation

### 3. Worker CLI Commands (`cli/worker_commands.py`)
- `worker start` - Start the background worker
- `worker stop` - Stop the worker gracefully
- `worker restart` - Restart the worker
- `worker status` - Quick status check (with --detailed option)
- `worker logs` - Tail worker logs in real-time
- `worker cleanup` - Remove stale files

### 4. Key Features
- **No psutil in hooks**: Git hooks use lightweight detection
- **Process validation**: Verify it's actually our worker process
- **Stale PID handling**: Automatic cleanup of dead processes
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux/Unix, degrades gracefully on Windows
- **Quick status**: Fast worker status without heavy imports

## Design Decisions

1. **Dual Detection Approach**:
   - WorkerManager uses psutil for full features
   - Git hooks use lightweight detection for speed

2. **/proc Validation**:
   - On Linux, validates process cmdline contains 'huey'
   - Falls back to checking if process is Python
   - On other systems, just checks process existence

3. **PID File Validation**:
   - Validates PID is numeric and positive
   - Cleans up stale files automatically
   - Uses file mtime as proxy for start time

## Security Considerations

1. **PID Validation**: Prevents injection via malformed PID files
2. **No Shell Commands**: All process checks use system calls
3. **Safe File Operations**: Atomic writes, proper error handling

## Testing Notes

The implementation has been tested for:
- Module imports successfully
- PID validation logic works correctly
- Worker detection functions as expected
- CLI command structure is valid

## Next Steps

This completes Phase 4. The worker detection is now more robust and reliable, making the git hooks better at determining whether to process synchronously or asynchronously.
