# Huey Tasks Security Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Incomplete path validation could allow access to `/app/project-evil` when project is `/app/project`
- **Fix**: Added `os.sep` to the security check to ensure proper directory boundary validation
- **Implementation**: `real_filepath.startswith(os.path.join(real_project_root, os.sep))`

### 2. Broken Task Retry Mechanism (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Exception handling prevented Huey's retry mechanism from working
- **Fix**: Restructured error handling to separate validation errors (non-retriable) from execution errors (retriable)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Validation errors return error dict
  - Execution errors raise exceptions for Huey to retry

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 3. Inefficient Batch Processing (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Serial processing in batch task blocked worker for entire duration
- **Fix**: Changed to enqueue individual tasks for parallel processing
- **Implementation**: Each file in batch is enqueued as separate task with task ID tracking

### 4. Database Connection Per Task (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Creating new database connection for every task was inefficient
- **Fix**: Added connection caching with `@lru_cache`
- **Implementation**: `get_storage_server()` caches connections by project root

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 5. Sensitive Data in Logs (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Full error messages could leak sensitive information
- **Fix**: Sanitized error logging with detailed info at DEBUG level
- **Implementation**: Only first line of errors at ERROR level, full details at DEBUG

### 6. Config File Read Per Task (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Reading config.json on every task added unnecessary I/O
- **Fix**: Added config caching with `@lru_cache`
- **Implementation**: `get_project_config()` caches configuration by project root

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Validation phase vs execution phase
2. **Resource optimization**: Connection and config caching reduces overhead
3. **Better parallelism**: Batch tasks now leverage multiple workers
4. **Improved observability**: Structured logging with appropriate levels

## Security Posture

The implementation now has:
- Robust path traversal protection
- Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive data
- Resource optimization that prevents DoS through connection exhaustion
- Reliable retry mechanism for transient failures

All security vulnerabilities identified by zen have been addressed.
