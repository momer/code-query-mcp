# Huey Tasks Implementation Review Context

## Overview
We've implemented the first step of our background processing system - the Huey task definitions. This is a critical component that will handle asynchronous documentation processing.

## Key Implementation Details

### Security Considerations
1. **Path Validation**: We validate all file paths using `realpath` to prevent path traversal attacks
2. **Project Boundary Enforcement**: Files outside the project root are rejected
3. **File Type Validation**: Only regular files are processed (not directories or symlinks)

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Huey with SQLite Backend**: Using SQLite for the job queue (`.code-query/huey_jobs.db`)
2. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Relative paths stored in database for portability
   - Absolute paths used only for external commands
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging
4. **Retry Logic**: Tasks retry 2 times with 60-second delay on failure

### Task Definitions
1. **process_file_documentation**: Main task for processing individual files
2. **process_documentation_batch**: Batch processing for efficiency
3. **health_check**: Simple task for worker monitoring

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `CodeQueryServer` class from storage layer
- Integrates with project configuration (model selection)
- Will be consumed by `huey_consumer` worker process

## Areas of Concern
1. **Subprocess Usage**: Using `subprocess.run` to call Claude CLI
2. **Parse Function**: Currently a placeholder - needs real implementation
3. **Database Connection**: Creates new connection per task execution

## Security Features Implemented
- Path traversal protection via `realpath` validation
- Project boundary enforcement
- No user input directly in subprocess commands
- Proper error message sanitization in logs

## Questions for Review
1. Is the security validation sufficient for background processing?
2. Should we pool database connections instead of creating per-task?
3. Is the subprocess approach for Claude CLI the best option?
4. Any other security concerns with the task definitions?
