# MCP Server Fix Summary

## Problem
The MCP server was failing to connect with Claude Code CLI due to using an outdated API. The error was:
```
AttributeError: module 'mcp.server.stdio' has no attribute 'Server'
```

## Root Cause
The main `server.py` file was using the old MCP API structure while the newer API had changed significantly.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated imports**:
   - Changed from `import mcp.server.stdio` and `import mcp.types as types` to:
   - `from mcp.server import Server`
   - `from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent`
   - `from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server`

2. **Fixed server initialization**:
   - Changed from `server = mcp.server.stdio.Server("code-query")` to:
   - `server = Server("code-query")`

3. **Updated type references**:
   - Replaced all `types.Tool` with `Tool`
   - Replaced all `types.TextContent` with `TextContent`

4. **Fixed the main() function**:
   - Updated the server run call to include proper initialization options
   - Added imports for `InitializationOptions` and `NotificationOptions`
   - Changed the server.run() call to include all required parameters

## Final Working Code Structure
The server now properly:
- Imports from the correct MCP modules
- Uses the current API's Server class
- Provides initialization options with capabilities
- Runs with the stdio_server context manager

## Testing
The server now starts without errors and is ready to be used with Claude Code CLI.
