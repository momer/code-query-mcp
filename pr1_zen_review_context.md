# PR 1 Implementation Plan - Review Context

## Project Context
The Code Query MCP Server is a tool that provides intelligent code search and documentation capabilities across large codebases. The current implementation has critical search issues due to the default FTS5 tokenizer splitting programming identifiers inappropriately.

## Current Problem
The default `unicode61` tokenizer breaks code search by:
- Splitting `my_variable` into `my` + `variable`
- Splitting `obj->method` into `obj` + `method`  
- Removing `$` from `$httpClient`

This makes it impossible to search for actual code patterns, which is the core value proposition of the tool.

## PR 1 Objective
Fix these critical issues with minimal risk by:
1. Configuring FTS5 tokenizer to preserve code-specific characters
2. Fixing a snippet display bug
3. Unifying query processing
4. Safely migrating existing data

## Related Context from Milestone Document
From ddd_milestone_breakdown_v3.md:
- This is the first and most critical PR in a series of 8
- It must be done before any other refactoring
- Expected to fix 80% of search quality issues immediately
- Zero risk to existing functionality if done correctly

## Code Style and Patterns
From existing codebase:
- Uses SQLite with FTS5 for search
- Migration system already in place (currently at v2)
- Logging via Python logger
- Transaction safety for schema changes

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot break existing searches
- Migration must be safe and reversible
- Performance should not degrade

## Review Focus Areas
Please review the PR 1 implementation plan focusing on:
1. **Completeness**: Are all the necessary changes identified?
2. **Safety**: Is the migration approach safe for production data?
3. **Testing**: Is the testing plan comprehensive enough?
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Are there risks we haven't considered?
5. **Implementation Order**: Is the step-by-step plan logical?
