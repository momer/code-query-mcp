# PR 6 Implementation Plan - Review Context

## Project Context
The Code Query MCP Server now has:
1. Fixed FTS5 tokenizer (PR 1 - complete)
2. Storage backend interface with DTOs (PR 2 - complete)
3. Query builder with fallback support (PR 3 - complete)
4. Search service with dependency injection (PR 4 - complete)
5. Dataset service with lifecycle management (PR 5 - complete)

PR 6 creates an application layer that orchestrates high-level documentation workflows, providing clean APIs for documenting entire directories and managing the documentation lifecycle.

## Problem Being Solved
- No high-level API for documenting directories
- File analysis logic mixed with storage concerns
- No batch processing optimization
- Limited progress tracking for long operations
- No abstraction for different file types
- Missing incremental update support

## PR 6 Objectives
1. Create application layer for documentation workflows
2. Implement efficient batch processing
3. Add file discovery with pattern matching
4. Support multiple language analyzers
5. Provide real-time progress tracking
6. Enable cancellation of long operations

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Separation of Concerns**: FileDiscovery, FileAnalyzer, and DocumentationService have clear responsibilities
2. **Analyzer Registry**: Extensible system for adding language support
3. **Batch Processing**: Configurable batching for efficiency
4. **Parallel Analysis**: Thread pool for CPU-bound analysis
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates without blocking
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Errors in individual files don't stop the process

## Technical Context
From previous PRs:
- StorageBackend provides the persistence layer (PR 2)
- DatasetService manages dataset lifecycle (PR 5)
- Services use dependency injection throughout
- DTOs ensure type safety across boundaries

From the milestone document:
- PR 6 is small size, low risk, medium value
- Provides high-level orchestration
- Should support batch operations for efficiency
- Focuses on documentation workflows

## Review Focus Areas
Please review the PR 6 implementation plan focusing on:
1. **API Design**: Is the DocumentationService API intuitive and complete?
2. **Batch Processing**: Will the batching strategy improve performance effectively?
3. **File Discovery**: Are the pattern matching and filtering approaches sound?
4. **Analyzer Architecture**: Is the analyzer registry extensible and maintainable?
5. **Progress Tracking**: Will the progress system work well for long operations?
6. **Error Handling**: Are errors isolated appropriately without cascading failures?
7. **Concurrency**: Are there any thread safety issues or race conditions?
8. **Performance**: Will this scale to large codebases (10k+ files)?

## Critical Considerations
1. **Memory Usage**: Large codebases could cause OOM with parallel analysis
2. **Cancellation Safety**: Must cleanly stop without leaving partial state
3. **Progress Accuracy**: Real-time updates without excessive overhead
4. **Analyzer Quality**: Language-specific analysis accuracy
5. **Batch Atomicity**: How to handle partial batch failures

## Architecture Implications
1. **Application Layer Pattern**: This establishes the pattern for other high-level services
2. **Analyzer Extensibility**: Sets precedent for language support
3. **Progress Infrastructure**: Could be reused for other long operations
4. **Batch Processing**: Pattern could apply to other bulk operations

## Performance Considerations
- Parallel file discovery for large directory trees
- Configurable thread pool for analysis
- Batch size optimization
- Memory-bounded operations
- Progress update frequency
