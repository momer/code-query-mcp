# Summary of Revisions Based on Zen's Feedback

## Key Changes Made

### 1. FTS5 Tokenizer Fix Elevated to PR 1
- Moved from "future consideration" to immediate critical fix
- Added `tokenize = 'unicode61 tokenchars ''_$@->::'''` to schema
- Included FTS index rebuild for existing data
- This addresses the fundamental issue breaking code search

### 2. PR Sequence Reordered
- **Old**: Extract services first, then storage interface
- **New**: Extract storage interface (PR 2) BEFORE services (PR 4-5)
- This prevents rework and builds services on clean interfaces from day one

### 3. Dependency Injection Enforced
- All services now receive dependencies via constructor
- No internal instantiation of dependencies
- Example shown in SearchService with all deps injected
- Added section on "Dependency Injection Setup"

### 4. Documentation Domain â†’ Application Layer
- Reframed as application-level orchestration
- Now in `app/` directory instead of domain directory
- Clarifies it uses core domains rather than being one

### 5. Storage Interface Made Domain-Oriented
- Changed from generic `execute_search()` to specific methods:
  - `search_metadata()`
  - `search_content()`
  - `get_file_documentation()`
- Storage layer now owns SQL query construction
- Services express intent, not implementation

### 6. Testing Strategy Enhanced
- Added incremental integration tests after key PRs
- Not waiting until end for integration testing
- Added performance benchmarking plan
- Specific test points identified

### 7. Added Implementation Principles Section
- Dependency Injection Throughout
- Domain-Oriented Interfaces
- Progressive Enhancement
- Test-First Development

### 8. Risk Mitigation Expanded
- Added specific tokenizer migration risks
- Interface stability considerations
- Service dependency management
- Data consistency concerns

## Questions for Final Review

1. Is the revised PR sequence optimal for minimizing risk while delivering value?
2. Are the storage interface methods sufficiently expressive for future backends?
3. Should we add a "Feature Flags" PR or include it in PR 1?
4. Any concerns about the Application Layer approach for documentation workflows?
5. Should analytics be a separate bounded context or part of Search domain?
