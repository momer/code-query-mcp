# PR 2 Implementation Plan - Review Context

## Project Context
The Code Query MCP Server needs to transition from a monolithic 1000+ line storage module to a clean domain-driven architecture. PR 2 establishes the foundation by extracting a storage backend interface with DTOs.

## Relationship to PR 1
PR 1 (now complete) fixed critical FTS5 tokenizer issues. PR 2 builds on that stable foundation to begin the architectural refactoring.

## Current State
- All storage logic in `storage/sqlite_storage.py` (1000+ lines)
- Direct SQL throughout the codebase
- No clear domain boundaries
- Difficult to test and extend

## PR 2 Objectives
1. Create abstract storage interface hiding SQL details
2. Define DTOs for type safety and clear contracts
3. Implement SQLite backend using existing logic
4. Enable future refactoring without breaking changes
5. Improve testability and performance with batch operations

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Gradual Migration**: Keep existing sqlite_storage.py working while building new infrastructure
2. **DTOs as Contracts**: Use dataclasses for all data crossing boundaries
3. **Batch Operations**: First-class support for performance
4. **Connection Pooling**: Handle SQLite's threading limitations properly

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot break existing functionality
- SQLite-specific optimizations should not leak through interface
- Performance must not degrade

## Review Focus Areas
Please review the PR 2 implementation plan focusing on:
1. **Interface Design**: Is the StorageBackend interface complete and well-designed?
2. **DTO Design**: Are the data models comprehensive and forward-compatible?
3. **Migration Safety**: Is the gradual migration approach sound?
4. **Performance**: Are batch operations and connection pooling implemented correctly?
5. **Testing Strategy**: Is the test plan thorough enough?
6. **Risk Assessment**: Are there unidentified risks?

## Technical Context
From the milestone document:
- PR 2 is a large, medium-risk change that blocks PR 4 and PR 5
- Introduces dependency injection pattern
- Foundation for entire DDD refactoring
- Must handle batch operations efficiently
