# Phase 1 PR Review Context for Zen

## Background
We're implementing automated queue processing for the code-query MCP project. The goal is to allow git hooks to queue documentation updates that are processed in the background using `claude --prompt`.

## Key Design Decisions
1. Using Huey with SQLite backend for queue management
2. Three-tier developer experience (zero-config → managed worker → auto-service)
3. Process-based worker detection using psutil
4. Graceful degradation with synchronous fallback

## Phase 1 Focus
This first PR implements the core queue processing infrastructure:
- Huey task definitions
- Worker detection
- Enhanced git hooks with mode detection
- Basic CLI commands for worker management
- Configuration extensions

## Questions for Review
1. Is the file structure optimal for maintainability?
2. Should we handle the Claude CLI integration differently?
3. Are there edge cases in worker detection we should address?
4. Is the testing strategy comprehensive enough?
5. Should we include more defensive error handling in the first PR?

## Specific Concerns
- The git hook needs to work in various environments (different shells, CI/CD)
- Worker detection must be fast to not slow down git operations
- Configuration changes should be backward compatible
- Error messages need to guide users clearly
