# PR 8 Implementation Plan - Review Context

## Project Context
The Code Query MCP Server has completed:
1. Fixed FTS5 tokenizer (PR 1)
2. Storage backend interface with DTOs (PR 2)
3. Query builder with fallback support (PR 3)
4. Search service with dependency injection (PR 4)
5. Dataset service with lifecycle management (PR 5)
6. Application layer for documentation workflows (PR 6)
7. Search analytics and monitoring (PR 7)

PR 8 is the final PR that extracts configuration management into a dedicated service, providing clean APIs for project settings and git hook management.

## Problem Being Solved
- Configuration logic scattered throughout sqlite_storage.py
- No centralized configuration management
- Git hook installation mixed with other concerns
- No configuration validation or versioning
- Missing configuration migration support
- No clear configuration API

## PR 8 Objectives
1. Extract all configuration logic into dedicated service
2. Centralize project configuration management
3. Provide clean APIs for git hook installation/removal
4. Support configuration versioning and migration
5. Enable configuration validation with defaults
6. Separate git-specific logic from general configuration

## Key Design Decisions
1. **JSON Storage**: Simple JSON files for configuration (not SQLite)
2. **Atomic Writes**: Write to temp file then rename for safety
3. **Automatic Backups**: Keep backups before modifications
4. **Version Migration**: Support upgrading configuration schemas
5. **Validation Layer**: Comprehensive validation with clear errors
6. **Git Hook Safety**: Check existing hooks, backup if needed

## Technical Context
From previous PRs:
- DatasetService (PR 5) needs configuration for dataset operations
- All services use dependency injection pattern
- System follows DDD principles with clear boundaries
- Git integration is important for workflow

From the milestone document:
- PR 8 is small size, low risk, low value
- Final cleanup PR in the series
- Should consolidate configuration concerns
- Focus on clean APIs

## Review Focus Areas
Please review the PR 8 implementation plan focusing on:
1. **API Design**: Is the ConfigurationService API complete and intuitive?
2. **Storage Safety**: Will atomic writes and backups prevent data loss?
3. **Validation Completeness**: Are all important fields validated?
4. **Migration Strategy**: Will version migrations work smoothly?
5. **Git Hook Integration**: Is the hook installation/removal robust?
6. **Error Handling**: Are errors handled gracefully with recovery?
7. **File Organization**: Is the configuration structure appropriate?
8. **Testing Coverage**: Are edge cases covered?

## Critical Considerations
1. **Existing Hooks**: What if users have custom git hooks?
2. **Permission Issues**: Config directory might not be writable
3. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple processes might access config
4. **Schema Evolution**: How to handle future config changes?
5. **Defaults vs Required**: Which config fields are mandatory?
6. **Environment Variables**: How do env vars override config?

## Architecture Implications
1. **Final Domain**: Completes the DDD refactoring
2. **Configuration Pattern**: Establishes config management pattern
3. **Git Integration**: Centralizes all git-related operations
4. **Service Dependencies**: ConfigurationService depends on DatasetService

## Performance Considerations
- Configuration is read infrequently (startup/changes)
- JSON parsing is fast for small configs
- File I/O minimized with caching in service
- Validation runs only on write operations
