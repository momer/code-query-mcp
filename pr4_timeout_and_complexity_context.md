# PR4 Timeout and Complexity Analysis Implementation Context

## Overview
This document provides context for the zen review of the timeout handling and query complexity analyzer implementations, which are the final two features of PR4 (SearchService with dependency injection).

## Project Goals
The Code Query MCP Server provides intelligent code search capabilities. PR4 focuses on creating a robust SearchService with dependency injection, feature flags, and security features to prevent DoS attacks and ensure reliable performance.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Query Timeout Handling (pr4-10)
**Purpose**: Prevent long-running queries from blocking the system

**Implementation**:
- Added timeout support to `SqliteBackend` using SQLite's interrupt mechanism
- Created `_query_timeout` context manager that uses threading.Timer
- Updated `search_files` and `search_full_content` methods to accept timeout_ms parameter
- SearchService passes `query_timeout_ms` from SearchConfig to backend methods
- Default timeout is 5000ms (5 seconds)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Used SQLite's native `interrupt()` method rather than killing threads
- Implemented as a context manager for clean resource management
- Timer is always cancelled to prevent thread leaks
- Timeout is configurable per-query through SearchConfig

### 2. Query Complexity Analyzer (pr4-11)
**Purpose**: Analyze queries to prevent DoS through overly complex searches

**Implementation**:
- Created `QueryComplexityAnalyzer` class that evaluates multiple metrics
- Analyzes: term count, operator count, nesting depth, wildcards, phrases
- Calculates estimated cost based on weighted features
- Determines complexity level: SIMPLE, MODERATE, COMPLEX, TOO_COMPLEX
- Integrated into SearchService with `enable_complexity_analysis` flag
- Provides simplification suggestions for complex queries

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Whitelist approach - analyzes legitimate query features
- Exponential cost for deep nesting (prevents ((((...)))) attacks)
- Configurable thresholds via SearchConfig
- Blocks queries before they reach the database
- Returns empty results rather than throwing exceptions (fail-safe)

## Architecture Patterns

### Dependency Injection
Both features follow the DI pattern established in PR4:
- QueryComplexityAnalyzer can be injected into SearchService
- Configuration is injected via SearchConfig
- Backend timeout is configurable per-search

### Feature Flags
Both features can be enabled/disabled:
- `enable_complexity_analysis` in SearchConfig
- `query_timeout_ms` (0 = disabled) in SearchConfig

### Security by Default
- Complexity analysis enabled by default
- Conservative default thresholds
- Timeout enabled by default (5 seconds)

## Test Coverage

### Timeout Tests (`test_query_timeout.py`)
- Context manager functionality
- Integration with search methods
- SearchService propagation
- Timer cleanup
- Concurrent timeout handling

### Complexity Tests (`test_query_analyzer.py`)
- All metric calculations
- Complexity level determination
- Edge cases (empty queries, deep nesting)
- Simplification suggestions
- Real-world query patterns

### Integration Tests (`test_search_service_complexity.py`)
- SearchService integration
- Feature flag behavior
- Warning/error logging
- Config propagation

## Security Considerations

### Timeout Protection
- Prevents slow queries from exhausting resources
- Uses interrupt mechanism (safe, doesn't corrupt state)
- Configurable per organization's needs

### Complexity Protection
- Prevents exponentially complex queries
- Blocks before database execution
- Clear feedback via warnings
- Suggestions help users fix queries

## Performance Impact
- Timeout: Minimal overhead (one timer per query)
- Complexity: Fast regex-based analysis before query execution
- Both features can be disabled if not needed

## Review Focus Areas
1. **Security**: Are there any ways to bypass these protections?
2. **Performance**: Is the overhead acceptable?
3. **Usability**: Are the default thresholds reasonable?
4. **Error Handling**: Do we handle all edge cases gracefully?
5. **Thread Safety**: Is the timeout mechanism thread-safe?
6. **Configuration**: Are the config options intuitive?
